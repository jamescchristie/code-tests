# WSD

To install:

`npm install`

Once all dependencies are installed:

`node app`


##Rationale

The project consists of three main directories, `config`, `routes` and `views` to separate the authorisation and server request logic as well as the templates and views for the handlebars framework.

Dependencies have been kept to a minimum favouring built in functionality rather than relying on frameworks.
